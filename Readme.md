# [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) for [MiSTer FPGA](https://mister-devel.github.io/MkDocs_MiSTer/)

## Description

I have been learning how to program and how to code in HDL, but I lack the fundamentals so I have hit a wall. I will publicly go through this course for anyone else to see. The course in question is here --> https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer

Hopefully I can make it through this course, I lack a lot of confidence and have significant mental disabilities but I need to push myself to advance.

Yes, other people have done this before, I'm not going to reference their work and am going to focus on doing this entirely myself. Also, I know that this probably seems easy, I'm 37 and my disabilities have only recently been diagnosed, this is a form of therapy for me, so be patient with me please :)

Wish me luck I guess :P
